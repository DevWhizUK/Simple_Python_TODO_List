# Command Line Todo List App 📚

This is a simple Python script for managing a command line-based todo list. It's lightweight, easy to use, and helps keep track of your tasks or items.

I mainly use it to keep track of the books I've bought and haven't read yet. This way, I can make sure I get to all of them without overcomplicating my Goodreads account.

## Features
- ✅ Add items to your todo list.
- ✅ Mark items as completed.
- 🗑️ Delete items you no longer need.
- 📋 View all items along with their completion status.
- 💾 Persistent storage — your list is saved between sessions.

Feel free to use or adapt this script for your own needs. 🎉
